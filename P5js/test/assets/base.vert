/*
uniform - unchanging values (uniform) for all triangles.
attribute - vertex attributes. each vertex has different values for each of these. 
these are the INPUTs for the vertex shader.
varying - these are the values that are interpolated (vary) between the vertices of
 a triangle. these are the OUTPUTs of the vertex shader and the INPUTs of the fragment shader.

the vertex shader runs for a single vertex and the `attributes` contain the values for 
that vertex. the vertex shader is responsible for outputting the corresponding `varying`
 values for its vertex. those varying values are then interpolated over the surface of
  the triangle and the resulting interpolated values are passed to the fragment 
  shader in varyings of the same name.
