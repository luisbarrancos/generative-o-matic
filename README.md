# Generative-o-matic

Assortment of [P5js](https://p5js.org/), [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [OpenFrameWorks](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) sketches.

## What is it then?

Some generative art sketches and simulations involving computer vision, optical flow, particles, vector fields, voice recognition via [Google's TeachableAI](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and [ML5js](https://ml5js.org/), feature tracking and sentiment analysis via [CLMTrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr).
For now [P5js](https://p5js.org/), only, but [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [OpenFrameWorks](https://openframeworks.cc/download/) sketches will follow shortly. 

## How can i use them?

You can try [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [P5.vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) extension, which pulls a live server, or you can try opening the HTML files in your browser. Note that some sketches require audio and/or webcam access, so make sure you are granting permissions for the sketches.
There's nothing suspicious about such access, but the sketches are small so even a beginner should be able to read them and feel reassured nothing abnormal is taking place.

## The exception(s)

Some sketches require running a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) server though.
[This sketch in particular](https://github.com/luisbarrancos/generative-o-matic/tree/master/P5js/multiplayer_fluids), which relies on [P5.multiplayer](https://github.com/L05/p5.multiplayer) in order to have multiple users interacting via a QR scanned UI/interface sketch in their mobile devices with a host sketch.
